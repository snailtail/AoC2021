    --- Day 16: Permutation Promenade ---

You come upon a very unusual sight; a group of programs here appear to
be dancing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyZQPjUT5B4&t=53>.

There are sixteen programs in total, named |a| through |p|. They start
by standing in a line: |a| stands in position |0|, |b| stands in
position |1|, and so on until |p|, which stands in position |15|.

The programs' /dance/ consists of a sequence of /dance moves/:

  * /Spin/, written |sX|, makes |X| programs move from the end to the
    front, but maintain their order otherwise. (For example, |s3| on
    |abcde| produces |cdeab|).
  * /Exchange/, written |xA/B|, makes the programs at positions |A| and
    |B| swap places.
  * /Partner/, written |pA/B|, makes the programs named |A| and |B| swap
    places.

For example, with only five programs standing in a line (|abcde|), they
could do the following dance:

  * |s1|, a spin of size |1|: |eabcd|.
  * |x3/4|, swapping the last two programs: |eabdc|.
  * |pe/b|, swapping programs |e| and |b|: |baedc|.

After finishing their dance, the programs end up in order |baedc|.

You watch the dance for a while and record their dance moves (your
puzzle input). /In what order are the programs standing/ after their dance?

Your puzzle answer was |ceijbfoamgkdnlph|.


    --- Part Two ---

Now that you're starting to get a feel for the dance moves, you turn
your attention to /the dance as a whole/.

Keeping the positions they ended up in from their previous dance, the
programs perform it again and again: including the first dance, a total
of /one billion/ (|1000000000|) times.

In the example above, their second dance would /begin/ with the order
|baedc|, and use the same dance moves:

  * |s1|, a spin of size |1|: |cbaed|.
  * |x3/4|, swapping the last two programs: |cbade|.
  * |pe/b|, swapping programs |e| and |b|: |ceadb|.

/In what order are the programs standing/ after their billion dances?

Your puzzle answer was |pnhajoekigcbflmd|.

At this point, you should return to your Advent calendar
